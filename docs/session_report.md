# AWS Data Pipeline Project Session Report

## Session Date: October 31, 2025

### Summary
This session focused on fixing region-related configuration issues in our AWS data pipeline project. Our main goal was to ensure all AWS resources would be deployed consistently in the US East (N. Virginia) region - `us-east-1`.

### Changes Made

1. **Provider Configuration Update**
   - Modified the main AWS provider configuration in `terraform/main.tf`
   - Changed from using a variable to explicitly setting the region to `us-east-1`
   - This ensures all AWS resources will be created in the same region

2. **Module Configuration Cleanup**
   - Removed provider configuration files from all modules:
     - S3 module
     - Lambda module
     - Lambda Layer module
     - EventBridge module
   - This prevents conflicts between different region settings
   - Modules now inherit the region setting from the main provider

3. **Verified Region Settings**
   - Confirmed correct `us-east-1` configuration in:
     - `variables.tf` (default region setting)
     - `locals.tf` (local variable definition)
     - `main.tf` (provider configuration)

### What This Means in Simple Terms
Think of this like setting up multiple branch offices for a company. Previously, our configuration was trying to set up offices in different cities (regions) at the same time, which was causing confusion. We've now:

1. Decided to focus on one main location (US East - N. Virginia)
2. Made sure all our paperwork (configuration files) points to this one location
3. Removed any conflicting address information from our department files (modules)

### Next Steps
1. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform
2. Verify all resources are created in the US East region
3. Test the data pipeline functionality

### Benefits of These Changes
- Simplified management: All resources in one region
- Reduced latency: Resources can communicate faster within the same region
- Better reliability: Avoiding cross-region dependencies
- Clearer organization: Consistent location for all resources
